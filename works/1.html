                        <p>For my first project in my Year 10 Digital Science course, I was asked to create a website with the following requirements:</p>
                        <br />
                        <ul class="list-disc">
                            <li>A landing page with a navigation bar in the middle of the screen.</li>
                            <li>An "About Me" page which would cover information about me, where I was born, my family and pets.</li>
                            <li>A "Hobbies" page, which would cover the things I love to do.</li>
                            <li>A "My Future" page, which would discuss where I want to live and what I want to be doing when I am 30.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <br />
                            The landing page of my website was simple yet effective, featuring only a navigation bar in the middle of the screen. This allowed visitors to quickly and easily navigate to each of the other pages, where they could learn more about me.
                            <br /><br />
                            The "About Me" page was a comprehensive look into my life, covering my background, family, pets, and values. I shared photos, stories, and personal reflections, providing a deeper understanding of who I am and what has shaped me.
                            <br /><br />
                            The "Hobbies" page was all about the things I love to do in my free time and why they are important to me. I wrote about my passions, interests, and how they shape my personality.
                            <br /><br />
                            The "My Future" page was a brief overview of my aspirations for the future. I shared my general ideas about where I would like to live and what I hope to be doing when I turn 30, without going into too much detail.
                            <br /><br />
                            I am proud of the final product of this project. It was a great experience to learn about website design and development, and I am pleased with the outcome. The website accurately reflects who I am and what matters most to me, and I am confident that anyone visiting it will gain a deeper understanding of my life, my passions, and my aspirations.
                            <br /><br /><br />
